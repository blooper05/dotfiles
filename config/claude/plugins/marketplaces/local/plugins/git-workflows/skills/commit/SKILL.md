description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.

## Execution Constraints

- Complete all operations in a single tool-call response.
- Issue tool calls only — do not emit any conversational text or messages.
